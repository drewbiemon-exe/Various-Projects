.SYNOPSIS
    Generates MSBT entries for char1 and char2 entries for use with Super Smash Brothers Ultimate

.DESCRIPTION
    This script takes a comma-separated list of names, a starting index, and an internal
    character identifier. It outputs two sets of entries:
      - char1: Title Case (used for character select)
      - char2: Uppercase (used for entering/winning matches)

.PARAMETER Name
    Single string converted to comma-separated list of character names. Example: "kirby, pikachu, perfect cell" results in "kirby" "pikachu" "perfect cell"

.PARAMETER StartAt
    Starting index for numbering. Useful when skin IDs begin at a non-zero value.

.PARAMETER InternalName
    Internal character identifier used by the game (e.g. "demon" for Kazuya).

.EXAMPLE
    ./MsbtNameGenerator.ps1 -Name "kirby, pikachu, coach" -StartAt 0 -InternalName "demon"

    Produces MSBT entries with labels nam_char1_00_demon â€¦ nam_char2_02_demon.
